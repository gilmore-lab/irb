## The Development and Dynamics of Cortical Motion Processing

### Study Background and Research Protocol

#### I.	Background

Despite its central importance for understanding developmental processes and disease, there is remarkably little evidence about the structural or functional development of the human brain.   One reason for this lack of evidence concerns the fact that brain imaging methods suitable for use with older children and adults, such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), cannot be used widely with young children or infants.   

Recently, Penn State’s University Park campus has made major investments in a brain imaging technology that overcomes this limitation.  With the support of funds from the SSRI and CYFC, a laboratory housing equipment for electroencephalography (EEG) research has been established.  EEG related techniques such as event-related potentials (ERPs) and visual evoked potentials (VEPs) can be used successfully to measure brain activity across the age span.  In particular, two high density (128 channel) EEG/ERP/VEP systems and a low density (1-32 channel) EEG/ERP/VEP system have been established to explore a wide-range of  research questions in human developmental neuroscience.  

The particular focus of this research study is on the use of steady-state visual evoked potentials (SSVEPs) to study patterns of brain development across the lifespan.  SSVEPs are brain electrical responses evoked by periodic or time-varying visual patterns that change at known temporal frequencies. SSVEPs have been used to study a variety of visual functions (Allen, Norcia, & Tyler, 1986; Birch & Petrig, 1996; Braddick, Birtles, Wattam-Bell, & Atkinson, 2005; Chen, Wu, & Wu, 1990; Di Russo, et al., 2006; Ding, Sperling, & Srinivasan, 2006; Krishnan, Skosnik, Vohs, Busey, & O'Donnell, 2005; Regan, 1976).  SSVEPs permit visual scientists to examine how the brain responds to specific visual patterns by examining the evoked waveforms using spectral analysis techniques such as Fourier analysis or related variants (Tang & Norcia, 1995). Spectral analysis techniques have higher signal to noise ratios than many other evoked potential methods, and thereby are especially useful in research with young children because fewer trials or repetitions are required in order to extract meaningful patterns in the evoked response.

The principal investigator, Rick O. Gilmore, Ph.D., Associate Professor of Psychology, is relatively new to the use of VEPs, but he has extensive experience studying basic visual processes in infants and young children (Gilmore, Baker, & Grobman, 2004; Thomas & Gilmore, 2004).  The purpose of this research study is to conduct pilot testing using VEPs pertaining to questions about the development of contrast sensitivity, motion coherence, and optic flow discrimination in infancy and early childhood.  These are all questions related to Gilmore’s overall research program concerning the development of perception and action early in life and their biological bases.

#### II.	Aims/Objectives

##### A.	To characterize changes in contrast sensitivity, motion coherence, and optic flow sensitivity from infancy through early childhood, and into early adulthood using steady-state visual evoked potential patterns.

##### B.	To compare how changes in one visual capacity, such as contrast sensitivity, relate to changes in others, such as motion coherence. 

#### III.	Methods

##### A.	Apparatus

###### 1.	PowerDiva low-density (32-channel) system

The display/data acquisition system to be used in these studies is called PowerDiva.  It was developed at the Smith-Kettlewell Eye Research Institute (SKERI) in San Francisco by Senior Scientist, Anthony Norcia, Ph.D. and his colleagues.  It has been in use for many years in the Norcia lab (Hou, Pettet, Sampath, Candy, & Norcia, 2003; Norcia, et al., 1991; Norcia, Tyler, Hamer, & Wesemann, 1989; Skoczenski & Norcia, 1999) and several other labs around the world.  A system duplicating the one in the Norcia lab at SKERI was installed in 214 Moore Building in the summer of 2006.  

The system consists of a set of EEG electrodes and amplifier. In this case, from 3-7 Grass Gold Cup electrodes will be attached to a Grass headbox and connected to a 32-channel Grass Model 15A amplifier with an integrated power supply.  The amplifier’s analog output cable is connected to an Apple Macintosh G4 computer via a National Instruments DAQ card.  This computer is called the host.  A second Apple Macintosh G4 computer controls the video presentation via a VGA cable connected to an external monitor and is called the video computer.  The video computer communicates with the host computer via a serial cable.  Both computers run versions of the PowerDiva software, currently version 3.4.  The PowerDiva software controls stimulus presentation and data collection, and ensures that the two are precisely synchronized.  The video monitors are described below.

###### 2.	PowerDiva/NetStation high density (128 channel) system

Electrical Geodesics, Inc. (www.egi.com) has developed a high density 128-channel EEG system that includes a patented geodesic sensor net that allows the rapid application and precise and repeatable placement of EEG electrodes on human participants, ranging from infants to adults.  The sensor nets connect to a 128-channel amplifier, and the amplifier sends digital channel data via a USB cable to a Macintosh computer running the NetStation 4.2 data acquisition software.  

The Human Electrophysiology Facility in 120 Chandlee Laboratory has two EGI systems, one of which has been slightly modified to interface with the PowerDiva system.  The modified system includes a separate Macintosh G4 computer for data acquisition using the NetStation 4.2 software, a custom external timing box designed by engineers at SKERI, and cabling that connects these to the PowerDiva video computer described previously.  That video computer controls visual presentation on one of two calibrated monitors described next.

###### 3.	Video monitors

One of two video displays will be used, depending on the specific type of assessment required.  One of the displays is a 20” diagonal Mitsubishi VGA monitor with multiple vertical refresh rates from 60 Hz to 120 Hz, a maximum pixel resolution of 1600x1200, and a 4:3 aspect ratio.  The second monitor is a 32” Westinghouse LCD flat panel display with refresh rates from 60 to 75 Hz, a maximum pixel resolution of 1365x768, and an aspect ratio of 16:9. The smaller monitor will be used when visual angles need not exceed 45 degrees of visual angle or when high resolution images are needed, such as in studies assessing visual acuity or contrast sensitivity in children.  The larger monitor will be used for studies of motion processing where larger visual angles are desirable. We expect that viewing angles will vary from about 30 to 60 deg, depending on the type of display being used.

The monitors are calibrated regularly to ensure that data acquisition is precisely coordinated with the vertical and horizontal refresh rates of the displays and to assure that luminances and contrast values remain within established ranges.  The monitors typically show luminances that range from approximately 5 cd/m2 to 110 cd/m2.

##### B.	Recruiting

###### 1.	Identifying and contacting participants

a.	Infant/Child participants

Infant and child participants are primarily recruited through the Families Interested in Research Studies (FIRSt) Families database which operates from the Child Studies Center at Penn State. The database contains names, mailing addresses, phone numbers, and dates of birth for potential participants and parent names.  All of the information in this database comes from local birth records in newspapers and hospital records which families volunteered.  In addition to the database, we also get child participants by advertising our studies in local childcare centers and online ads.
.  

We will recruit children and infants from the database, as follows:

i.	Determine the pool of eligible children based on age and, if available in the database, birthweight criteria.

ii.	Prepare and send letters to the families of the eligible children.

iii.	Contact the families by telephone, and prescreen as indicated in the section below.

iv.	If the family is interested and the child is eligible, schedule an appointment.

Families not participating in FIRSt Families, who see our advertisements contact us for more information, in turn we:

i.	Determine the eligibility of the child(ren).

ii.	Schedule and appointment if the child is eligible and the family wants to participate

b.	Adult participants

Adult participants will be recruited from the Psychology Department participant pool, in accordance with the guidelines for the use of the pool:

i.	An announcement describing the study will be posted on-line, along with available testing times in blocks of 1 hour.

ii.	The announcement will specify the exclusionary criteria as indicated in the section below.

iii.	Participants will sign-up for scheduled sessions using the participant pool calendar/scheduling system.

##### C.	Prescreening

Time varying visual patterns have been shown to induce seizures in a small subset of individuals.  Prevalence rates have been estimated at 1/10,000 in the general population, and 1 in 4,000 among 5-24 year olds (Fisher, Harding, Erba, Barkley, & Wilkins, 2005; Harding, Wilkins, Erba, Barkley, & Fisher, 2005).   There is no reported data about the prevalance of photically-induced seizures in children under 5, but it is presumably quite small.  Photically- or pattern-induced seizures do not require a prior diagnosis of epilepsy, but children with juvenile myoclonic epilepsy can show prevalence rates of 15-20% or higher.  Thus, we plan to prescreen participants for prior diagnosis of epilepsy or prior history of photically-induced seizures.  In addition, to ensure that participants are healthy and have had no serious health problems that could complicate the interpretation of our data, we will also screen for prematurity, birthweight, visual impairments, and other serious health problems.  Only those participants who pass our prescreening requirements will be invited to participate in a SSVEP study.  

###### 1.	Infant and child participants

For infant and child participants, prescreening will be conducted during the telephone call in which the families will be recruited to participate in the study.  A research assistant will ask the families to answer a short set of yes or no questions about their child’s health.  If the parent indicates that their child has one of the risk/exclusion factors, that child will not be invited to participate in this study.  These questions are asked again on the day of the scheduled session to ensure that the infant or child is eligible.

###### 2.	Adult participants

The internet/web page used to recruit adult participants will indicate that only healthy individuals with normal or corrected-to-normal vision, and no history of epilepsy or photically-induced seizures, will be permitted to participate.  In addition, a research assistant will ask the prospective participant to answer the same set of questions posed to the parents of the infant and child participants.  If the participants indicate that they fall into one of the excluded categories, they will be told they cannot participate in the study.

##### D.	Testing

###### 1.	Informed consent

Infant and child participants and their parent or parents will be escorted to the Human Electrophysiology Facility (HEF)  in 120 Chandlee  Laboratory.  There, an experimenter will explain the nature of the study and obtain informed consent or assent.   Adult participants will typically meet the experimenter in 120 Chandlee  Laboratory.   In some cases, adult participants will not be prescreened, and so the screening process will occur when the participant comes to the lab.

###### 2.         Vision Screen

Several visual acuity measures are performed before EEG data is collected. These measures do not act as a screen for data collection, but may aid interpretation of possible outliers during future data analysis. All acuity performance data is recorded silently by the experimenter, and no indication of performance is provided to the participant.

a.) For assessing Snellen Optotype Acuity  in adults, we use an optoptype acuity chart similar to those seen in most optometry facilities. Participants are asked to read aloud, row by row, the letters they see on the chart.
  i.) For testing infants and children, we use Teller Acuity cards. The cards each have a striped black-and-white pattern either on the left or right side of the card. The stripes vary in thickness (or spatial frequency), with thinner stripes requiring a higher acuity to detect than thicker stripes. Cards are presented to infants in a manner similar to a game of “peek-a-boo”, in which the experimenter presents the card while hiding his or her face from the infant. During this hiding period, the experimenter can look through a hole in the card to assess the direction of the infant's gaze. The experimenter will make a two-alternative forced choice ("left" or "right"), then turn over the card to see on which side the stripes were located, and determine if the infant looked in the correct direction. Stripe thickness will decrease as trials continue, until the infant loses interest, or the experimenter has decided that the infant's gazes are no longer predictive of stripe location. Child subjects are also tested using the Teller cards, but the child is instead instructed to raise the hand corresponding to the side on which the stripes appear on each card (e.g., raise left hand for stripes on the left side).

b) For the Ishihara Color Vision Test, we use a booklet with patterns designed to allow subjects with normal color vision to discriminate numbers and shapes. 

c) For the Worth Binocular Fusion assessment, participants wear special dichoptically tinted glasses and look at a device similar to a flashlight. They are asked to determine the number of dots they see when viewing binocularly, as well as monocularly with left and right eye. Normal binocular fusion yields predictable reports of number of dots.

d) For testing Stereoacuity,  participants wear special polarized sunglasses and look at a booklet with a few different tasks. Each of the tasks require that the subject point to elements of pictures that appear to "pop out" to them. The elements differ in their extent of pop-out salience--and therefore require different stereoacuities to detect.

###### 3.	Electrode application

Once informed consent has been obtained, the experimenter will measure the circumference of the participant’s head (in cm) using a tape measure.  For studies involving the 128-channel EGI system, the participant’s head diameter will determine the size of the electrode net that will be used.  For studies involving the low-density system, head diameter information is used in determining the spacing of the individual electrodes according to the standard 10/20 or 10/10 electrode placement schemes.  The participant will be asked to sit in a comfortable chair during the process of electrode application.  Infants and young children will sit on a parent’s lap, where a second experimenter will help parents ensure the child’s comfort while maintaining their attention and interest.  There are two electrode application procedures depending on whether the 128 or 32-channel system is being used:

a.	128-channel electrode application procedure

The experimenter will soak the geodesic sensor net in a KCl solution.  The net will be dried slightly with a towel and then the net will be applied to the participants’ head in one smooth motion, beginning from the back of the head and moving to the front.  The process is similar to applying a swimming cap.  Once the net has been positioned properly, the participant will move to the testing room.  There, the net will be connected to the EEG amplifier and measurements will be taken from the electrode array to indicate which electrodes are making acceptable electrical contact with the scalp.  Typically values less than 50 kOhms are optimal.  As necessary, the experimenter may make slight adjustments to the net position or apply small additional amounts of the electrolyte solution to individual electrodes.  Once the experimenter determines that there are a sufficient number of electrodes making acceptable electrical contact, the experimenter will start the display presentation.

b.	32-channel electrode application procedure

The experimenter will use a mildly abrasive paste (NuPrep; D.O. Weaver & Co.) with cotton swabs in order to clean the skin area underlying the desired electrode positions.  In practice, there will be a minimum of three (3) electrode sites and a maximum of seven (7).  Once the skin has been cleaned, each electrode will be applied to the scalp individually.  The electrodes (Grass Gold Cup) will be filled with an electrically conducting paste (Ten20; D.O. Weaver & Co.) that is water soluble and approximately the consistency of hair gel.  The electrode wires will be fixed to the participant’s clothes near the shoulder using masking tape.  In addition, we will wrap the participant’s head with a self-adhesive, non-sticky, medical tape to keep the electrodes in their desired positions.  Once the electrodes have been applied, the participant will move to the testing room.  Infants and young children will sit on their parent’s lap.  The electrodes will be attached to the 32-channel amplifier, and an experimenter will test whether the electrodes have acceptably low impedance, typically in the range of 5-10 kOhms.  If impedance is unacceptable, the experimenter may need to adjust or reapply one or more electrodes.  Once the experimenter determines that impedances are acceptable, the experimenter will start the display presentation with a key press.

###### 4.	Display presentation

Once the experimenter begins the display, the stimulus will appear and begin varying according to the frequency and other parameters set by the experimenter. During the trial, adults and older children may be asked to maintain fixation on a central fixation cross.  Infants will be induced to keep looking at the center of the display by means of a small toy suspended from a string in front of the computer monitor.  In all cases, the experimenter will monitor the participant’s direction of gaze, and will suspend the trial with a key press if the participant looks away.  When the participant looks back at the screen, the trial will continue, with another key press.  In between trials, participants will be encouraged to blink, look away, and otherwise rest their eyes.  The order of testing is usually random.  For infants, we will usually attempt to test 3-5 stimulus conditions and collect 3-5 trials per condition in a single visit.  For adults, we may test 8-10 conditions with up to 20 trials each per condition.  

The international community has developed voluntary guidelines for visual displays that are designed to minimize the risk of inducing seizures (Fisher, Harding, Erba, Barkley, & Wilkins, 2005; Harding, Wilkins, Erba, Barkley, & Fisher, 2005; Wilkins, Emmett, & Harding, 2005).  To the extent possible, we intend to present displays that abide by these guidelines.

For illustrative purposes, the following describes the three main types of displays that will be presented in different conditions of the study.

a.	Motion coherence paradigm.

One powerful measure of sensitivity to motion is called motion coherence.  It is a measure of the proportion of moving dots in a display that must be moving with the same motion characteristics (speed, direction) in order for the perceiver to see patterned motion.  Motion coherence displays vary the proportion of dots moving in the same direction against a background of dots moving randomly.  

The PI, Gilmore, and colleagues reported on a SSVEP study of motion coherence reported at the Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology (ARVO) in May 2006 (Hou, Gilmore, Pettet, & Norcia, 2006), which he plans to replicate and extend at Penn State.  That study involved presenting displays of approximately 1,000 white dots on a black background.  The dots moved in a circular pattern around the center of the monitor at speeds ranging from 3 to 18 deg/s, and dot displacement rates of 15, 20, or 30 Hz.  The coherence of the motion varied at .83 Hz, meaning that the dots moved coherently for 1/.83 or 1.2 s, and then moved randomly at the same speed for 1.2 s.  In this study, a total of 10 such cycles were presented per trial.

These sorts of displays seem to pose minimal risk for photically-induced seizures. The patterns do exceed the recommended stimulation area of 0.006 steradians (approximately 4.5 deg of visual angle) or the recommended maximum luminance of 50 cd/m2. But, these guidelines were primarily developed for flashing patterns.  The dots do not flash, but move continuously in one direction for half of the motion cycle.  Harding et al. (2005) state “If the patterns obviously flow smoothly across, into, or out of the visual field in one direction, they are less likely to provoke seizures (p. 1424).”  Moreover, the frequency of direction reversal is below the recommended norm of 3 Hz for flashing displays. 

b.	Contrast sensitivity paradigm.

Contrast sensitivity refers to the smallest difference between dark and light striped areas that an individual can discern at a given stripe width.  Generally speaking, adults are most sensitive to low contrast at middle stripe widths (spatial frequencies), and sensitivity falls off as stripes get wider or narrower.  Infants’ contrast sensitivity is skewed to lower spatial frequencies (larger stripe widths) and higher contrasts.

To assess contrast sensitivity, black and white stripes are presented to the participant in a time varying way, such that the stripes appear or disappear against a gray background.  Typically, a sweep VEP procedure is used in which the contrast or difference in luminance between the black and white bars goes from high to low or low to high across a trial with the spatial frequency held constant.  

For example, one study that illustrates the approach the PI plans to take (Lauritzen, Jorgensen, & Michaelsen, 2004) used a grating of 1 cycle/deg with a mean luminance [(white+black)/2] equal to 47.6 cd/m2.  Over a 10 s sweep period, the contrast increased in 10 logarithmic steps and the pattern reversed from black to white at a rate of 6.0 Hz.  The contrast range tested varied depending on the age of participants, but was between 40% and 1%.  The participants were infants 6-40 weeks of age.

In contrast to the motion coherence paradigm, the display characteristics used in this study, which are typical in this sort of research, do not meet the guidelines set forth by Harding et al. (2005).  The stimulation frequency exceeded 3 Hz, the displays consisted of contrast reversing gratings whose changes in luminance during the early part of the sweep exceeded 20 cd/m2, the size of the area of stimulation exceeded 4.5 deg, and the duration of this stimulation exceeded .5 s.  On the other hand, by not presenting displays in color, these sorts of studies do follow one component of the Harding (2005) guidelines.

There is flexibility in the choice of the specific parameters an experimenter chooses in studying contrast sensitivity; some parameter choices make a meaningful difference in the measurement, while others do not.  For the purposes of this part of the protocol, it seems difficult if not impossible to abide by the Harding et al. (2005) guidelines and therefore reduce the risk of photically-induced seizures beyond their base rates in the population.   At the same time, assessments of visual acuity and contrast sensitivity are essential basic components of our proposed study of visual development.  Accordingly, for participants who will contribute to this portion of our study, we intend to monitor behavior especially closely in the testing session for evidence of photically-induced seizure activity.  Section 5 below discusses the protocol that will be followed should the investigator observer or the participant report a seizure during the stimulation phase.

c.	Optic flow displays.

Optic flow refers to the complex pattern of motion that a moving observer generates through locomotion.  Optic flow patterns provide essential information to moving observers about their direction and speed of motion through the environment.  These patterns of motion are thought to activate higher order visual processing areas in the parietal and temporal lobes, and thus, studying the development of optic flow processing may serve as an index of maturation for higher order visual processing areas (Gilmore et al., 2004).  

The PI has recently reported evidence from an SSVEP study of optic flow processing in infants and adults (Gilmore, Hou, Norcia, & Pettet, 2006).  In that study, infants (4-6 months of age; n=12) and adults (21-43 years of age; n=12) passively viewed translation (left/right), expansion/contraction (forward/backward), and rotational optic flow displays that reversed direction at 2 Hz.  The displays consisted of approximately 1,000 white dots on a black background in a field of view that was 20x20 deg in size. 

Like the motion coherence displays described previously, these displays appear to pose minimal risk for photically-induced seizures, as they fall within the display guidelines recently suggested (Fisher, et al., 2005; Harding, et al., 2005; Wilkins, et al., 2005).

###### 5.	Clean-up and debriefing

Once the experiment has ended or the experimenter has terminated the testing, the participant will be disconnected from the amplifier and escorted to the waiting area.  There, the electrodes will be removed and the scalp cleaned.  Arrangements for participant payments will then be made, and the participant and/or parent will be debriefed further about the outcome of the study.  

Following the participant’s departure, the electrodes will be cleaned and disinfected, and electronic data files will be saved and stored safely.

###### 6.	Identifying and mitigating risk in the event of an induced seizure

In developing procedures for identifying and mitigating risk in the event of a photically induced seizure, we have consulted extensively with Matthew Eccher, M.D., Assistant Professor of Neurology, at the Hershey College of Medicine.  Dr. Eccher has agreed to provide training to research staff on the identification of epileptic symptoms and the recommended first aid procedures to be followed should a participant experience a seizure.  All research staff will complete this training prior to testing participants.  In addition, the training procedures will be videotaped for use in training research staff who join the lab in the future.

Measuring the EEG response to photic stimulation (intermittent photic stimulation or IPS) at flash rates from 5 to 25 Hz is a common laboratory practice.  Kasteleijn-Nolst and colleagues (Kasteleijn-Nolst Trenite, Guerrini, Binnie, & Genton, 2001) offer the following set of symptoms which the experimenters in our protocol must be alert to.  These are as follows:

-	Focal repetitive twitches or jerks in one hand, arm or hemiface with no loss of consciousness.
-	Generalized myoclonus, usually symmetric and affecting the upper limbs.  Mostly mild.
-	Forced involuntary turning of the head and eyes toward one side.
-	”Absence” seizures – spells characterized by complete loss of awareness without any obvious outward manifestation of seizure.
-	Strictly subjective visual seizures with visual symptoms such as illusory rings, spots, or more complex forms.
-	Generalized tonic-clonic seizure—a “grand mal.”  

The experimenter will monitor the participant visually throughout the testing procedure.  Should the experimenter observe or the participant report any of these symptoms, the experiment will be terminated immediately. 

If the symptoms do not immediately subside, the experimenter will take immediate steps to ensure that the participant does not injure her or himself during the seizure.  As a general practice, the region around the testing chair where participants will sit will be kept clear of sharp objects or furniture that might cause injury were the participant to fall. Any seizure type other than generalized tonic clonic seizure can be expected to stop immediately with termination of the visual stimulation, and no further intervention is anticipated to be necessary other than stopping the study.  In the unlikely event of a generalized tonic-clonic seizure, standard first aid measures will be initiated, to include easing the subject to the floor, guarding his or her head from striking the floor, and lying them on their side until the seizure ceases.  If the experimenter judges it is necessary or the participant requests it, the experimenter’s or research assistant will use the telephone in the lab waiting room adjacent to the testing suite to call 911 for emergency medical assistance.

###### 7.	Evidence or suspicions of child abuse.

It is extremely unlikely that our protocol will result in an experimenter either observing an episode of abusive behavior or finding evidence that such an episode may have occurred.  It is possible, however, that an experimenter might notice unusual bruising, abrasions, or swelling on a child.  If an experimenter or research assistant notices any of these and or has concerns that a child may be suffering abuse, the following procedure will be followed after the visit has ended and the participant and family have left the Moore Building:

a.	The experimenter or research assistant will contact the PI to schedule a meeting to discuss the concerns.

b.	The PI will determine the nature of the concerns and whether they warrant reporting to the appropriate authorities.  As necessary, the PI will consult with experts in the Psychology Department’s Psychological Clinic.  Dr. Pamela Cole, Professor of Psychology, has agreed to provide this sort of guidance, as necessary.

c.	If the PI believes the concerns warrant reporting, the PI will contact the Child Abuse Hotline (800-932-0313).
