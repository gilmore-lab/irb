[If the study involves vision screening, staff will read the following to each child older than 8 years of age]

*Today we are going to ask you to tell us how well you can see.  We are going to ask you to look at some pictures and answer some questions, like what shape or letter you see.  For one of the tests, you might have to cover one of your eyes.  For two of the tests, we’ll have you wear special glasses.  For one of the tests we’ll have to turn down the lights and shine a special flashlight. Your mom or dad will be here the whole time. We want you to have a good time, so if you are not happy with something, please tell us.  You do not have to do things you do not like.*

[If the study involves EEG recording, staff will read the following]

*We are going to listen to your brain while you look at some pictures on a screen.  We will put some wires on your head to help us listen to what your brain is doing. Your head might itch a bit, but we want you to have a good time.*

[If the study DOES NOT involve EEG recording, staff will read the following]

*We will ask you to look at some pictures on a screen.  We might also ask you to tell us what you see on the screen, but otherwise, you just have to look.*

[For all participants, staff will read the following]

*You might get a little tired of watching the screen, but we want you to be happy about your time with us. If you are not happy with something, please tell us.  You do not have to do things you do not like.*

*Do you have any questions?*

*You can sign your name here.  If you do not know how to sign your name, then you can just put your best mark here.*
