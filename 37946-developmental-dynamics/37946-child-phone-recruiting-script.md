## The Development and Dynamics of Cortical Motion Processing

### Telephone script for recruiting and screening infant and child participants

*Hello, this is {name of researcher} from the Brain Development Lab at Penn State.  May I speak to Mr. or Ms. {last name of child}?*

IF PARENT IS HOME AND AVAILABLE TO SPEAK 

*I am calling to follow up on the letter we sent recently about a study of visual perception.  We would like to invite {name of child} to participate in our study.  Is this a good time to talk about the study?*

IF PARENT SAYS YES

*The study focuses on how the brain responds to visual information and how brain responses change as children mature.  We are testing children who are {age of children desired} in our lab on campus.  The testing involves recording the brain’s electrical responses while children watch changing images on a computer screen.  It would take about one hour in total, and we would provide you with a thank you gift of $10 and a special “Junior Brain Scientist” certificate in appreciation.  If you are interested, I would need more information about {child’s name} to determine if he or she is eligible for the study.*

IF PARENT EXPRESSES INTEREST

*1.	Was {child’s name} born prematurely or below normal birthweight?*

*2.	Did {child’s name} experience any serious medical problems at birth or shortly thereafter?*

*3.	Does {child’s name} have any serious health problems now?*

*4.	Does {child’s name} have any visual problems such as lazy eye or cataract?*

*5.	Has {child’s name} ever been suspected of having epilepsy, or had seizures when watching TV, movies, or a computer screen?*

*6.	Has {child’s name} ever had seizures when {he or she} was sick?*

IF PARENT ANSWERS NO TO ALL QUESTIONS

*Thank you. {child’s name} is eligible for our study.  We have appointments available on {state next set of available appointments}.  What would be most convenient for you?*

*That’s great.  Let me tell you how to get to the lab and where we will meet you.*

FOR STUDIES AT THE MOORE BUILDING

The lab is located in the Moore Building.  We’re not far from the Nittany Lion Inn.  Do you know where the Allen Street entrance is to campus off of Park Avenue?  Moore is on Fischer Road, the first right after you turn on Allen from Park.  Moore is the first tall building on your left.  We’ll have a researcher meet you there and give you a parking pass for the Nittany Lion parking deck.

FOR STUDIES AT SLEIC

The lab is located in Chandlee Lab.  We’re in the middle of campus, across Pollock Road from Old Main.  Do you know where the Shortlidge Street entrance is to campus off of College Avenue? Take Shortledge until the T-intersection with Pollock Road. Turn left. Tell the Parking Attendant at the Kiosk that you are coming to Chandlee Lab for an appointment at the imaging center. We’ll have a researcher meet you there and give you a parking pass.

(Researcher gives more instructions about how to meet parent).

IF PARENT ANSWERS YES TO ONE OR MORE SCREENING QUESTIONS

*We have very strict rules about who we can test, and I’m afraid that we can’t test {child’s name} at this time.  Thank you very much for your time.  Good-bye.*

IF PARENT IS NOT INTERESTED IN THE STUDY

*I understand.  Thank you very much for your time.  May I call you in the future about another study?*

IF PARENT AGREES TO BE CONTACTED AGAIN

*I will make a note in our files to contact you in the future.  Thank you again.  Good-bye.*

IF PARENT DOES NOT WANT TO BE CONTACTED AGAIN

*That’s fine.  I will make a note in our files that you do not want to be contacted again.  Thank you.  Good-bye.*

IF PARENT IS UNAVAILABLE TO SPEAK TO THE CALLER

*I would like to call back at a more convenient time.  When would be a good time to call?  (Parent answers).  Very good, I will make a note and have someone call you back then.  Thank you.  Good-bye.*
