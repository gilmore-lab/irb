[If the study involves vision screening, staff will read the following to each child older than 8 years of age]

*We are going to ask you to complete a set of simple vision tests where you will tell us what you see or do not see.*  

[If the study involves EEG recording, staff will also read the following]

*We are going to measure your brain’s response to different visual patterns.  First, we will measure the size of your head, and then attach a set of wires to it.  The wires are called electrodes, and they will be connected to a computer.  They let us “listen” to what your brain is saying.   We will either put on a small number of electrodes individually or ask you to wear a special cap that has 128 electrodes that can be connected all at once.  Before we put on the electrodes, we may need to clean your head with a special paste, sort of like a hair gel.  After the electrodes are in place, we will ask you to sit in a special chair and watch a series of pictures on a computer monitor. Your mom or dad will be in the testing room with you at all times.  We will record your brain activity while you watch the computer.  Each display takes about 10 seconds each, and there will be 30 to 80 of them to watch in total.  The displays will consist of black and white stripes that flash on and off or dots that move in different directions; and other similar, simple black and white patterns.  We will take short breaks between the displays, and a longer break about half-way through.  When we have finished, we will take the electrodes off and clean your head.*  

[If study DOES NOT involve EEG recording, staff will read the following]

*We will ask you to sit in a special chair and watch a series of pictures on a computer monitor. Your mom or dad will be in the testing room with you at all times.  We may record where you look or ask you to press buttons, move a mouse, or say out loud whether you can see something in the display.  Each display takes about 10 seconds each, and there will be 30 to 80 of them to watch in total.  The displays will consist of black and white stripes that flash on and off or dots that move in different directions; and other similar, simple black and white patterns.  We will take short breaks between the displays, and a longer break about half-way through.*

[For all participants, staff will read the following]

*If you get tired or want to take a break, just say so.  If you think you may be blanking out or you realize you can’t remember what’s happened for some period of time while you’re watching the displays, let us know.  If you suddenly notice you’re twitching or jerking involuntarily, let us know.  If something else strange or unpleasant happens and you want to stop watching the displays, just let us know.  You do not have to watch everything unless you want to.*

*Do you have any questions?*

*You can sign your name here to show that you understand what I have told you.*
