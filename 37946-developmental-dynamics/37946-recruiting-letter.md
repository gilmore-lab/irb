Dear ________ and _________,	

IF INFORMATION COMES FROM PARENTS WHO HAVE COMPLETED A FIRSt FAMILIES DATABASE INFORMATION FORM

Your child ________   _________   has been chosen as a possible participant in a study that is being conducted by researchers at The Pennsylvania State University.  Your family’s name was obtained from Families Interested in Research Studies (FIRSt Families) database.  As you may recall, your participation in FIRSt Families makes your name available to researchers at Penn State who are doing research with children and their families.

IF INFORMATION COMES FROM A PUBLISHED BIRTH ANNOUNCEMENTS

Your child _________ _________ has been identified as a possible participant in a study that is being conducted by researchers at the Pennsylvania State University.  Your family’s name was originally obtained from a birth announcement from the Centre Daily Times.

Our current study is called The Development and Dynamics of Cortical Motion Processing in Children and Adults and the principal researcher is Dr. Rick O. Gilmore. In our study, we are investigating how the brain responds to visual information and how this response develops from infancy to adulthood. If you decide to participate, we will ask that you come to 120 Chandlee Laboratory for a one-hour session. 

During the session, your child will watch a variety of black and white images on a computer screen while we observe, measure, and record their brain activity.
Your time and effort will be acknowledged with a payment of $10.00 for the session.  Most importantly, your participation will contribute to our greater understanding of human visual perception and brain development.
For scientific and safety reasons, however, we cannot test every child.  So, before scheduling an appointment, we will need to ask you whether your child was born prematurely, has any serious medical or visual problems, has a history of epilepsy, or has ever experienced a seizure while he or she was watching TV, movies, or a computer screen, or during another illness? If you answer “yes” to any of these questions, we will not be able to test your child.

We hope that you consider participating in our study. We will contact you soon to give you more information about our research. You may also contact us at 814-863-3116 or by e-mail psubrainlab@mac.com. More information is also available at http://brainlab.psych.psu.edu

We thank you in advance for your time.

Sincerely,  

The Brain Development Laboratory
