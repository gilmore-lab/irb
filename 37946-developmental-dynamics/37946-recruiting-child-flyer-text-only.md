## Looking for Child Scientists

Get your child involved in science! The Brain Development Lab at Penn State University is looking for subjects aged 4 to 8 years for a study on visual perception. We are interested in how the brain responds to visual information and how this response develops from infancy to adulthood.

During the study, your child will watch a variety of black and white images on a computer screen while we observe, measure and record their brain activity. We will acknowledge your time and effort with a payment of $10.00 per session. Most importantly, your childâ€™s involvement will contribute to our greater understanding of human visual perception and brain development.
