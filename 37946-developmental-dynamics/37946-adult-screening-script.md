# The Development and Dynamics of Cortical Motion Processing

## Experimenter script for screening adult participants

*Hello, I am {name of researcher} from the Brain Development Lab at Penn State.  If you are here for the study, then we can go into the lab room where I can describe the study and get some more information about you.*

*The study focuses on how the brain responds to visual information and how brain responses change as we mature.  We are testing adults who have normal vision or have corrected vision in the normal range.  The testing involves recording the brain’s electrical responses while you watch changing images on a computer screen.  It will take about one hour in total, and you can either earn course credit or $10 for your participation. Before we proceed, I need more information about you to determine if you are eligible for the study.*

*1.	Were you born prematurely or below normal birthweight?*

*2.	Did you experience any serious medical problems at birth or shortly thereafter?*

*3.	Do you have any serious health problems now that would preclude you from participating in this study?*

*4.	Have you ever been treated for visual problems such as lazy eye, or cataract?*

*5.	Have you every been diagnosed with epilepsy, had seizures when watching TV, movies, or a computer screen, or had seizures when you had a fever?*

*6.	If you wear glasses or contacts, are you wearing them now or do you have them readily available?*

IF PARTICIPANT ANSWERS NO TO QUESTIONS 1-5, AND YES TO QUESTION 6.

*Thank you. You are eligible for our study.  I will now explain more about the study so that you can decide whether you want to participate.* (Experimenter continues with process of obtaining informed consent.)

IF PARTICIPANT ANSWERS YES TO ONE OR MORE OF QUESTIONS 1-5

*We have very strict rules about who we can test, and I’m afraid that we can’t test you at this time.  Thank you very much for your time. Good-bye.*

IF PARTICIPANT ANSWERS NO TO QUESTIONS 1-5, AND NO TO QUESTION 6.

*Thank you.  You are eligible for our study. But, without your glasses or contacts, we will have to find another time for you to participate. Let’s see what other times are available.*  (Experimenter helps participant schedule a new appointment.)
