## The Development and Dynamics of Cortical Motion Processing

In this study, we recorded electrical signals from your brain while you watched visual patterns that changed in time.  Because we can control the frequency of those changes, we are able to examine the pattern of electrical signals for evidence that your brain responded to these visual patterns specifically, and not merely to other visual or non-visual information.  By examining how strongly your brain responds to some patterns versus others, we hope to determine the sorts of visual patterns that activate your visual system most strongly.  Then, we plan to compare the results obtained from adults like you with those obtained from infants and children.  Our ultimate goal is to better understand how the visual parts of the brain develop from infancy into adulthood.

We thank you for your participation in this study.

If you have any questions, please ask the experimenter or Dr. Rick Gilmore (rogilmore@psu.edu; 865-3664).
