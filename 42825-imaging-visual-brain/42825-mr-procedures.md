1. Verbal prescreening prior to visit

A research staff member will contact the participant in advance of the testing session and ask about prior MR scans, surgeries, implants, eye injuries, tattoos or permanent make-up, personal and family seizure history, and clautrophobia.

	Thank you for your willingness to participant in our study. In order to ensure your safety during the scan, I need to ask you a few questions.

	a. Have you ever had an MRI before?

	b. Have you ever had any heart, brain or inner ear surgery? 
		If YES find out the details of the surgery and refer them to MR Technologist

	c. Have you ever had any surgery where anything was implanted in your body such as rods, pins, screws, clips, wires, pacemaker, inner ear tubes? 
		If YES refer to MR Technologist

	d. Have you ever had injuries involving metal to your eye? 
		If YES refer to MR Technologist

	e. Do you have any tattoos or permanent makeup?
	 	If YES determine location and type and discuss with MR Technologist.

	[If participant answers yes to any of b.-e., the staff member will inform the participant that more information is needed before a scan can be scheduled.]


	f. Have you ever had a seizure or has any family member had a seizure?
	
	[If participant answers yes to f., the staff member will inform the participant that he or she is ineligible for this particular study.]

	g. Are you claustrophobic? 

	[If participant answers yes, the staff member may want to schedule time to have the participant determine their level of comfort in the mock scanner.]

	If you have any piercings you will be asked to remove them prior to the MRI. We also suggest that you wear loose fitting clothing such as sweatpants [for women: a sports or similar bra without underwires.]  There will be a secure place for you to store your belongings during the scan.

	[In some cases, we may send the particpant the SLEIC MRI Screening Form via email in advance and ask them to complete and bring it to their scheduled session.]

2. Screening -- day of visit

A research staff member will greet the participant in 6 Chandlee. On some occasions, the participant will be greeted and the following procedures carried out in 7 Chandlee.

a. The research staff member will explain the goals of the study and what will occur.

b. The research staff member will provide the participant a copy of the SLEIC MRI Screening Form and ask them to complete it.

c. The research staff member will provide the participant a copy of the informed consent document for the study. The staff member will ask the participant to read the document and to sign where indicated if he or she consents to participate.

d. The research staff member will review the SLEIC MRI Screening Form and ensure that the participant has signed it. If the staff member notes whether there is anything reported on the screening form that should be brought to the MR Technologist's attention.

e. The research staff member will review the informed consent document, ensure that the participant has signed and dated it, and then the staff member will sign and date it, as well.

f. The research staff member will escort the participant to 7 Chandlee. The participant will be asked to remove all metallic objects and given an opportunity to change clothing into hospital scrubs if he or she wishes. The research staff member will assist the participant in storing their valuables in the lockers provided in 7 Chandlee.

g. The research staff member will assess visual acuity.  If the individual wears glasses, their visual acuity without glasses will be tested so that we may prepare a set of glasses that best correct for their visual deficit.  The glasses consist of empty frames in which lenses of varying strengths (-6 to +6 diopters) can be placed individually  to correct for deficits in each eye.  The strength of the lens used will depend on the individuals' visual acuity in that eye, as determined by a simple optotype (letter) acuity test.  The glasses correct only for spherical aberrations, not cylindrical ones, and so people with astigmatism may still  experience a degree of visual blur wearing the glasses. In some cases, we may screen, consent, and conduct visual testing and goggle fitting in advance of the MRI testing session.  In this case, the participant will be credited for the time they spend  in the pretesting session.

h. The research staff member will notify the MR Technologist when the participant is ready to be scanned. At that time, the research staff member will provide the MR Technologist with the signed screening and consent forms for the MR Technologist to review.

i. The MR Technologist will review the screening form and escort the individual to the 7 Chandlee control room to interview the participant about the information reported.

j. If the MR Technologist determines that it is safe to scan the participant, the MR Technologist will escort the participant into the magnet room.  The participant will lie on the MRI scanner bed which will slide inside the scanner bore for imaging. The participant will have a small squeeze ball to communicate with the control room at all times. Participants will wear either earplugs or earphones or both to provide hearing protection. The research staff member will ensure that the participant can see the visual display, test that the response equipment is working properly.

3. Testing procedure

a. Once positioned in the magnet, the MR Technologist and research staff member will leave the scanner room and close the scanner room door.

b. The research staff member or MR Technologist will communicate with the participant via intercom. The research staff member will inform the participant whenever scans are about to start, and remind them to relax and try not to move.

c. For some scans involving the collection of structural information, the participant may lie still with their eyes closed. At least one such scan will be taken for each session.

d. For other task-related scans, the participant must actively participate by looking at the display and making perceptual judgments. In these cases, participants will view a 1024x768 pixel 60 Hz display presented on a projection screen positioned outside of the magnet bore.  Participants will view the screen by looking straight up at a set of mirrors attached to the head coil. The display will subtend up to 40 deg horizontally and 30 deg vertically.  Display images will be produced by custom software using the public domain Psychophysics Toolbox and MATLAB running on a computer running Mac OS X or Windows 7. The computer will send video output via a fiber optic cable to an MR-compatible projector located in the magnet room. Participants' behavioral responses (button presses) will be sent via fiber optic cable to a computer in the control room.

e. Before each task-related scan, the research staff member will remind the participant of the task they are to carry out. In our studies, most of the stimuli will be abstract geometric patterns (checkerboards, stripes) or moving dots.  Some stimuli may be photographs of human faces, common household objects, landscapes, and the like. In an example of one type of study, participants may be asked to press a button each time they detect a change in a moving pattern of dots. In another study, they might be asked to judge which of two abstract 3D shapes is more "attractive" and to press a key to indicate their choice. In another study, they might be asked to rate the "symmetry" of a repeating abstract pattern on a 1-4 scale. Based on the pattern of key presses, we may calculate the visibility, attractiveness, or symmetry of one kind of visual image relative to another or may analyze the patterns of response speed and accuracy. Most task-related runs will take 3-10 min each.

In some studies, we may need to collect more than one run of task-related data. In that case, we would give participants a rest period of 2-5 min between task-related scans or interleave task-related and structural scans.

The typical session will consist of one (1) ~5 min structural scan, 2-3 task-related scans, and will take 30-60 min in total.

f. After all the task-related and structural scans have been completed. The MR Technologist and research staff member will enter the scanner room and help the participant from the scanner bed, and escort them back to the 7 Chandlee waiting room. The participant may retrieve his or her belongings from the secure locker. If the participant changed clothing, they may change back. If the participant is receiving payment, the payment form is processed and signed. If they are receiving course credit, that credit information is recorded. The research staff member escorts the participant out of the 7 Chandlee testing suite and thanks them for their participation.

g. The research staff member will place any corrective glass lenses back in the storage case. The MR Technologist will clean and disinfect the scanner in preparation for the next participant.
